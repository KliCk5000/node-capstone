## Screens the user will interact with:

MVP Important:

- Notes: enter notes

Future Feature screens:

- Landing page to describe what the app is (requirement for project)
- Sign-up or log-in screen, and a way to reset password
- After login, see any alerts for contact reminders
Click on their name to go to their record
Possibly click on call/text/email to do the action and automatically create log of communication
- Once the correct client is found or created, add point of contact (could use the word point in naming of app? - Nevermind, point of contact refers to the person that a client communicates with, not the action of communicating)
- Choose type: Phone Call/Text/Email/In Person
- Followup Needed? Yes/No
- Date/Time for reminder to follow up
- Recurring reminder?
- Click to view recent contacts with this client
